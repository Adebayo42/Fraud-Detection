# 🚀 Fraud Detection Model: Advanced Machine Learning Pipeline

## 🔍 Overview
Fraud detection is a critical challenge in the financial sector, requiring cutting-edge machine learning techniques to stay ahead of evolving threats. This project implements a robust **fraud detection pipeline** utilizing **stacked ensemble models** to achieve **high accuracy (98.1%) and a strong ROC-AUC score (93.5%)**.

### 📌 Key Features:
- ✅ **Multi-Model Approach**: Uses **Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, HistGradientBoosting, XGBoost, and a Stacking Classifier**
- ✅ **Advanced Preprocessing Pipeline**: Handles missing values, categorical encoding, feature scaling, and oversampling (SMOTE)
- ✅ **Optimized Performance**: Balances bias-variance tradeoff using an ensemble of classifiers
- ✅ **Scalability**: Can be extended for real-time fraud detection in banking, e-commerce, and cybersecurity

## 🛠 How It Works
1️⃣ **Data Preprocessing**:  
   - Merging transaction & identity datasets  
   - Handling missing values with imputation & encoding  
   - Feature scaling & transformation  

2️⃣ **Model Training & Stacking**:  
   - Train individual models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc.)  
   - Combine them into a **Stacked Ensemble Model** for maximum performance  

3️⃣ **Evaluation & Performance Metrics**:  
   - Accuracy & ROC-AUC scores computed  
   - Stacked Model outperforms individual models

## 🏆 Why This Project Stands Out
- 🔹 **Demonstrates real-world data science skills**: feature engineering, imbalanced data handling, model optimization  
- 🔹 **Employs advanced ensemble learning techniques** for **better fraud detection** than traditional ML models  
- 🔹 **Scalable & adaptable** to real-world financial applications
